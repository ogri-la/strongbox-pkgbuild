### Added

* added support for parsing multiple interface version values from .toc file.
    - a single .toc file may now yield multiple possible game tracks (retail, classic, wrath, etc).
* added entries to the known patch list for the recent major Dragonflight patches and The War Within.

### Changed

* the WoW column in the GUI now supports displaying multiple game versions (like 8.0, 9.0, 10.0).
    - these are derived from interface versions (80000, 90000, 100000).
* the raw data GUI widget in the addon details pane now supports displaying multiple interface versions.
* replaced references to the old wiki with the new wiki (warcraft.wiki.gg).
* bumped dependencies.

### Fixed

* fixed a typo in a field name in the import/export logic.
* fixed a bug in the interface-version => game-version logic where 110000 was returned as '1.0.000' instead of '11.0.0'.

### Removed

* removed curseforge and tukui test fixtures and the fetching of test fixtures.
* removed support for 'release labels' attached to addon source updates.
    - only supported by curseforge and provided a friendlier label for a release than a version number.
* removed more curseforge and tukui logic that was disabled many releases ago.
* removed support for interface versions in .toc files containing non-numeric values.
    - for example, "30008a" which used to parse to "3.0.8a".
    - the interface version for these alpha and beta releases don't actually have 'a' and 'b' suffixes.
