### Added

* added another heuristic for guessing which asset in a Github release supports retail.
    - in this case, if there is a single remaining unclassified asset, and there are other classified assets and nothing has been classified as retail yet, classify that asset as retail.
        - yes, this is guessing, and it won't always be correct, but it's probably true most of the time.
    - thanks @jake770321
* error handling for a few cases where uncaught exceptions were being swallowed.

### Changed

* installing an addon by file now overwrites/updates ignored addons and unpins pinned addons.
    - this accommodates a use case where Strongbox is used to install a select few addons manually from unsupported sources (like Curseforge) but then the new addons match against older versions in the catalogue from wowi.
    - please open a feature request if you want this behaviour adjustable.
* updated internal constants for The War Within.
* updated internal constant for the date of the previous expansion.
    - affects how much the emergency 'short' catalogue gets truncated from the 'full' catalogue.
        - emergency catalogue is used when Github hosted catalogue is unavailable, which is rare.
* trimmed the '(Flatpak)' from the 'Strongbox (Flatpak)' on the `.desktop` files distributed by Flatpak.
    - thanks @deadmeu

### Fixed

* fixed bug in emergency 'short' catalogue generation.
    - it would include addons from BFA instead of stopping at Shadowlands.
* fixed bug where installing a file manually would bypass ignored and pinned addon checks.
    - it would tell you it was refusing to install, then install it anyway.
    - thanks @akanouras
* fixed bug where ignore check bypassed on ungrouped/single directory addons.
    - logic assumed all addons were grouped, but grouping only happens when an addon unzip to multiple directories.
    - pretty big bug!
